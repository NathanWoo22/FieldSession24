Template Matching Algorithm by Thuan Nguyen, Adam Bukres, and Nathan Woo

The initial approach without the use of a gas tank template is found within the main branch of this repository.

Our final and most accurate approach is found in the gas-tank-template branch of this repository and reads in the gas_tank26.npy from the datasets folder.

Both approaches can be run via the command "python3 ./read_pcd.py" and will read from the provided ROS2 publisher.
